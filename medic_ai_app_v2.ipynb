Also being a rich source of vitamin A and D, cod liver oil can be taken orally as daily supplements. It is used as an adjunct treatment and preventative therapy of rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis while meeting the consumption criteria.', 'indication': 'Cod liver oil is predominantly manufactured, marketed, and used by the population at large as a general nutraceutical dietary supplement [A27154, A33159, L2872].\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'state': 'State not available.', 'simplified_mechanism': 'This medicine works by as cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha), vitamin a, and vitamin d [a33159, l2872, l2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin a, and vitamin d on drugbank.', 'simplified_toxicity': 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the toxicities of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank'}\n",

Also being a rich source of vitamin A and D, cod liver oil can be taken orally as daily supplements. It is used as an adjunct treatment and preventative therapy of rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis while meeting the consumption criteria.', 'indication': 'Cod liver oil is predominantly manufactured, marketed, and used by the population at large as a general nutraceutical dietary supplement [A27154, A33159, L2872].\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'state': 'State not available.', 'simplified_mechanism': 'This medicine works by as cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha), vitamin a, and vitamin d [a33159, l2872, l2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin a, and vitamin d on drugbank.', 'simplified_toxicity': 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the toxicities of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank'}\n",
